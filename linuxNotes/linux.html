More Controll over machine

Available everywhere including windows
To be a webdeveloper or other coding positions, you need to learn linux


2 types of operating systems
Microsoft
Other systems like linux, mac, etc

A shell is a compute interface to an operating system. he shell takes the command and give it to the operating system to perform


Commands

whoami : username
man : manual for commands
pwd : shows the directory working on
ls : shows the list
Options : -a shows all the files including hidden files
                -l shows the long list of the file
Cd : changes the directory
Options : cd .. Changes to the previous dir
                Cd ../ changes to the parent directory
                 Cd ~ changes to home directory
mkdir : makes a new directory
Options : mkdir greenhouse/winter creates 2 folders
                mkdir -p greenhouse/winter/seeds create a                   folder named seeds inside the folder winter                   inside the greenhouse
touch : creates empty folder. We can make folder with . txt, . png, . img, etc
If we create a touch folder which alredy exists it only update the folder with that name
rmdir : removes empty directories(files). If the file we choosed to remove have a subdirectory it wont remove that directory  only the empty folders
rm : removes empty directories just like rmdir.
Options : rm -r dirname deletes the directory.
                rm -ri gives a list of folders in the directory                    to select them to dlete or not by typing y or n
                 rm -rv removes the folders in reverse order
open : open lets you open the files. To open files in windows, you need to install 'sudo apt install xdg. Utils
mv : rename the folder or move the files from one folder to another folder. 
Options : mv blu blue lets you rename the file blu into                  blue
                 mv blue dir/ moves the file blue to the                            folder dir
cp : copies a file to another folder. We can copy a folder and its contents using -r
head : prints the first few lines of a folder. 
Options : head anime.txt -n 100 prints fist 100 lines
tail : prints last few lines of the 
Options : tail anime.txt -n 50
Options : head/tail -f gives live update of the lines of file we selected
Date : to show date
Using this > symbol we can store the data into a folder
Example : date > dir stores the date into the dir
whoami >> dir
date >> dir
Pwd >> dir stores multiple data into dir
cat : just like tail and head it prints the content of a folder, but it prints all the line of the folder unlike head and tail.
Cat dir1 dir2 prints content of multuple folder 
cat -n dir prints contents with number. So we can find the number of line we want
Less : prints content of file according to need. Like cat. G for the end of line. g for front of line. We can search for words in the content with /.
echo : prints what we type after command echo inside "  ". We can store them to a folder using > symbol
Wc : prints how many lines, words, bytes are in a file.
Piping : using | symbol is piping. We can sort or uniq after using pipe symbol
Sort : sort the files content in revere, ascending order or numeric order, etc
Uniq : like sort commaand. But it sort duplicate and non duplocated contents of a file
Options: uniq -d sort duplicated lines
               Uniq -u sort non duplicated lines
Expansions : echo * prints all the names of directory
echo *. text prints all the. txt files
echo *.?? Prints the files with 2 characters after . example,  .js .py
echo app. {py, html, css} prints app. py, app. html, app. css
If we remove echo and add touch, it will create those files
echo day{1..99} prints num from 1 to 99
diff : find difference btw two directories
find : find the word or contents we search.
Options: find .  -name '*.js' searches for. Js files
find .  -type d -name '*e*' searches for directories with letter e in it
grep : finds the words and contents in line by line with number by using -nC, -n, -r
du : to print size of data. -h for human understanding. -m for megabyte. -g for gigabyte. You can pipeline it with sort or uniq
df : juat like du but prints data usage.
history : to print the commands we run. Typing ! Symbol and a number from history executes that command
ps : print status. Prints the running process
top : to list the running process in real time
Kill : the kill command interact with the running process and kills them by the number of lines
Options : kill -9 num, sigkill
killall : just like kill, it kill all the process
jobs command is used to run or stop a process. Top is a process. It can be running in front by using fg and run in bg using bg. By pressing ctrl+z stops the process. Or it runs in the bgbor fg.
gzip -k is used to compress a file into . g.zip. we can unzip it by removing the og file and use gzip -d filename or gunzip command.
tar is used for extraction. 
tar -cf archive.tar file1 file2 creates and copy the files into the archive.tar. then we can mkdir new folder and mv archive.tar into that folder. We can view the archive.tar by using tar -tf archive.tar
We can extract the tar by using tar -xf archive.tar.
To reduce the size of file, we can remove the files and gzip the archive.tar then gunzip it. Then use tar -xf archive.tar.
nano : to edit text
alias
xargs : xargs acan be used as pipeline to remove or list a file
ln : there are two types of links. Hardlinkand softlink. 
ln original.txt hardlink.txt for hardlink. If you delete the original link the hardlink still store the same content of original link.
ln -s original.txt hardlink.txt for softlink. If you dlete original link the symbolic link will lose the content of original link
If we search for a folder tgee would be alot a files with that name appear. But if we use a symbolic link for important files, when we search for it we will manage to find it easily.
who : lists the users ofthe system
su : switch users
sudo : super user do. To install new commands we can use sudo. If we cant edit a text using nano we can do it by using sudo.
passwd : to change our password or change another users password under your system
chown : used to change the ownership of a file. Using sudo we can change the ownership of a file to ours.
Option : chown sudo owner filename
Then you will access to edit only that file.
Option : if you have a group and you want to make that group a ownership then,
sudo chown owner:group filename
Permissions in linux :
If thefirst character of permission is - , it is a regular file, if it is d, it is a directory. If it is c, it is special character file. If it is l, it is symbolic link
After the first word, there are 9 symbols in there. First 3 is the permission status for the owner, second 3 symbol is the permission for group, last 3 is for other users (world).
r - read
w : write 
x - execute ( cd )
' - ' no permission

chmod : we can change the pemission settings of file by using vhmod command
Options : chmod a+w filename gives permission to write to everyone. 
a - all
u - user
g - group
o - world

+ : add permission
'-' : remove permission
= : add permission and remove ither permissions

r - read
w : write 
x - execute ( cd )
' - ' no permission</p>
